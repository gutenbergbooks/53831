<div class="adtitle2">New Entertainment Songs<br />

<small>By Edna Randolph Worrell.</small></div>


<p>These songs can be used in all manner of entertainments. The music
is easy, and both music and words are especially catchy. Children like
them. Everybody likes them. Sheet music. Price 25 cents each. Five
copies, $1.00.</p>

<p><b>WE HOPE YOU’VE BROUGHT YOUR SMILES ALONG.</b> A
welcome song that will at once put the audience in a joyous frame of
mind and create a happy impression that will mean half the success of
your entire program. Words, bright and inspiring. Music, catchy.</p>

<p><b>WE’LL NOW HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.</b> This beautiful song
has snap and go that will appeal alike to visitors and singers. It is just
the song to send your audience home with happy memories of the occasion.</p>

<p><b>WE’VE JUST ARRIVED FROM BASHFUL TOWN.</b> This song
will bring memories to the listeners of their own bashful school days.
Words, unusually clever. Music, decidedly melodious. A capital welcome
song, or it may be sung at any time on the program with assured success.</p>

<p><b>MY OWN AMERICA, I LOVE THEE.</b> A song that will bring
a thrill of patriotism to the heart of every one who hears it. The children
and grown-ups just can’t resist the catchy music. It makes a capital
marching song.</p>

<p><b>COME AND PARTAKE OF OUR WELCOME CAKE.</b> A merry
welcome song and a jolly one, too. The audience will be immediately
curious about the Welcome Cake, and the children will love to surprise
the listeners with the catchy words. Music, easy and tuneful.</p>

<p><b>LULLABY LANE.</b> The music and words blend so beautifully that
people will be humming the appealing strains long after they hear this
charming song. A wonderfully effective closing song, whether sung by
the school or as a solo by a little girl, with a chorus of other little girls
with dolls.</p>

<p><b>JOLLY PICKANINNIES.</b> Words by Elizabeth F. Guptill. Music
by Edna R. Worrell. This spicy coon song will bring down the house,
especially if you use the directions for the motions which accompany the
music. The black faces and shining eyes of the pickaninnies will guarantee
a hit. The words are great and the music just right.</p>

<p><b>THE LITTLE BIRD’S SECRET.</b> Here is just the song for those
two little folks to sing together. They won’t have to be coaxed to sing
it, especially when they find that the whole school is to whistle the chorus.
This is a decided novelty, and will prove a rare treat to your audience.</p>

<p><b>A GARDEN ROMANCE.</b> This is a dainty little song telling of the
romance and wedding of Marigold and Sweet William. It is just the
song for dainty little girls to sing.</p>

<p><b>COME TO THE NURSERY RHYME GARDEN AND PLAY.</b>
Here is something different for the little folks to sing. The Nursery
Rhyme Folk are so familiar to children, it will be no trick for them to
remember the words. The music has a most captivating swing.</p>

<h2>Christmas at Punkin Holler</h2>


<p><i>SCENE:</i> <i>The schoolroom. The necessary articles of furniture
are the teacher’s desk and chair, and a couple of long wooden
benches, or settees, if the benches are not to be easily obtained.
The pupils are moving around, talking, laughing, and romping;
making considerable noise and confusion. Miss Peppergrass enters,
in hood and shawl, and speaks, but fails to make herself heard.
She removes her wraps, hanging them on a nail near her desk, and
rings bell smartly. School slowly becomes quiet, but the pupils do
not seat themselves. Instead, they stare, wonderingly, at teacher.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Take your seats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span>—Don’t hafter. It’s a hollerday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—I should say as much, judging by the noise you were
making; but we can not rehearse for the entertainment to-night in
the midst of such a racket as that. It sounded like a den of wild
beasts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jacob</span>—So ’twas, Teacher—a regular circus. I’m a lion, and I’m
a-goin’ to eat Sally up! (<i>Pounces on Sally, and begins to growl,
and to pretend to eat her. Sally screams.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—(<i>ringing bell again</i>) That will do, Jacob. Now, children,
take your seats. We must have it quiet. (<i>Children crowd into
seats. Johnny tries to pass the end of one seat, but is held back
by Lucindy. He struggles.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—What’s the trouble there, Lucindy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucindy</span>—Johnny won’t set down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnny</span>—No such a thing, Teacher. I was a-goin’ ter set down,
and she grabbed onto me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucindy</span>—He wasn’t! He was a-goin’ right by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnny</span>—Well, I was a-goin’ to set down in my own seat. I
don’t like to set there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—But we are reserving the seats for the visitors. There
will be a great many here to-night, you know. Don’t you want to
be a little gentleman, and give up your seat to some one—your
mamma, perhaps?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnny</span>—Huh! Ma couldn’t git herself into <i>that</i> seat. She’s too
fat. Pa’s a-goin’ to bring a chair for her, ’cause she couldn’t git
into <i>any</i> seat, ’thout you tooked away the desk first!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Well, some one may want it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnny</span>—They do. I want it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—(<i>sharply</i>) Well, you can’t have it! Now sit down at
once in the place assigned you, or—(<i>she takes a switch from her
desk.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnny</span>—(<i>seating himself</i>) You don’t give up your seat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Ah, but I shall to-night, Johnny. I shall give it, as
the seat of honor, to our supervisor, Mr. Barker. I shall be glad
to give it to him, Johnny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jake</span>—(<i>aside</i>) Sure she will. She’s settin’ her cap for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—(<i>sharply</i>) What’s that, Jacob?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jake</span>—I wish you wouldn’t call me Jay <i>Cup</i>. Nobody else ever
did. I’d as lief be called Jay Saucer, any day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—We won’t argue the matter, Jacob. I asked you what
you said to Johnny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jake</span>—I was jest a tellin’ him thet you was more politer than
him, that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Indeed! We will rehearse now, for this evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sammy</span>—Be n’t we a goin’ ter trim that ere tree?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patty</span>—We brung a heap o’ popcorn, Teacher, all strung.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsey</span>—And we’ve made paper chains, ’n tied up a lot o’ but’nuts
in colored paper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span>—’N ma’s made doughnuts ’n tied ’em up in blue ribbing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sammy</span>—Please can’t we trim it fust?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—No indeed, you must all rehearse your parts first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jacob</span>—Can’t we lug it in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span>—Then we could look at it while we was ’hearsin’.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—It might take your attention. No, let it remain where
it is for the present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnny</span>—It wants ter be brung in here fer the presents. ’Sides,
there ain’t no presents ben brung yit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—It must remain outside until after the rehearsal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sammy</span>—Somebody may steal it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—I hardly think so, with woods all around us. A tree
would hardly be worth stealing, Sammy. Silence now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sammy</span>—(<i>aside</i>) Somebody may steal it, all the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span>—Kin we rehearse in custum?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—In what, Hiram?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span>—In custom. In our other rigs—our fol-de-rols ’n doodads
that we’re go’n ter wear to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Oh, your costumes? Certainly, if you have brought
them. (<i>Those who are to change clothing, rush out, pellmell.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>—Cuss is a bad swear word, Teacher. Ma licked me when
I said it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—I should suppose she would. Little boys mustn’t say
naughty words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>—But you said it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—I? Oh no, Reuben, I wouldn’t say a naughty word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>—But you did say it, jest the same. You told ’em ter put
on their cuss tunes, ’n ef it’s bad ter call er cow a cuss, it’s bad ter
call a tune one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Their costumes, Reuben. Their other clothes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>—Oh! (<i>aside, as Aunt Hepsey enters</i>) But she did say it,
’n she said it agin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Hepsey</span>—How de do, Miss Peppergrass! I thought I’d jest
drap in to hear the perliminaries, bein’s I couldn’t git out to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—(<i>offering chair</i>) You are very welcome, Miss Bascom.
But do come to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Hepsey</span>—(<i>sitting down heavily</i>) Suz me, child, I dassn’t!
I kaint posserbly go out arter dark, count ’o my rheumatiz. Cripples
me all up. I’ll enjy it jest as well now, though, so jest go right
ahead, same’s ef I warn’t here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sammy</span>—Was that ere tree all right when you come in, Aunt
Hepsy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Hepsy</span>—Land, yes, Sammy. Why shouldn’t it be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucindy</span>—Sammy’s afraid a bear’ll come along ’n eat it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sammy</span>—Haint neither, but I’m worried ’bout that ere tree.
Somebody might steal it.</p>

<p>(<i>Re-enter Hiram. He has pulled on the Santa Claus trousers
over his overalls, and stuffed a pillow in front. He is endeavoring
to place one behind.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>—That’s a cuss tune all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Reuben!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>—Well, you say it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—I certainly did not. Say costume, Reuben.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>—You don’t like it when I say it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—You haven’t said it yet. Say it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>—(<i>sulkily</i>) Cuss tune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—No, not cuss, cos. Cos-tume. Say it correctly or I shall
punish you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>—Cuss, cuss tune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—(<i>shaking him</i>) Cos! Say cos.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>—(<i>whimpering</i>) Cu—cuss—cos!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—(<i>shaking again</i>) Tume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>—(<i>whimpering louder</i>) Tune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—No, tume. Now say costume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>—Coss—tume! Boo, hoo, hoo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Now sit down and behave yourself. (<i>Reuben sits down,
and sulks.</i>) (<i>Hiram has been industriously stuffing in the back
pillow, but the front one has fallen on the floor.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span>—I kaint git on these ere britches ter save my gizzard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Hepsy</span>—Well, I sh’d think you might, Hi, I sure do. They’re
big enough for old Paul Clear, let alone Hi Whittaker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span>—Big enough! Guess they be, Aunt Hepsy, but fast ez
I git the front piller in, aout it draps while I’m a gittin’ in the one
behint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Let me help you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span>—Guess I’ll hafter, Teacher, sure. Nice big baby I be,
kain’t dress myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Bring in the tunic, and then we’ll see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span>—The two whats?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—The tunic. The blouse. The rest of the suit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span>—Oh, the jacket? But there ain’t but one, less ’n you
count the belt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Bring the whole of it here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span>—And the mask? ’N the cap ’n whiskers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Yes, the whole of it, and hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Hepsey</span>—Jest you come here, Hi. I’ll fix you up. Go
right on ’ith your programmy, Miss Peppergrass. I’ll tend ter him.
I’ve rigged many a Santy Claws in my day.</p>

<p>(<i>She assists Hiram, while the rehearsal goes on.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Now, children, we must get to work, or we will not be
through by the time they want to trim the tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sammy</span>—Somebody’ll steal it afore then. Better bring it in,
Teacher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—The tree is all right, Sammy. Now I have the programme
all arranged, and we will proceed just as we shall to-night.
First will be the welcome song.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhoda</span>—Ma says Ruby oughter say his welcome piece fust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Oh no. We will sing first, then Reuben will speak his
piece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>—(<i>starting up</i>) I’m a-goin’ ter speak first. Ma said so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Sit down, Reuben, till I call your name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>—(<i>still standing</i>) Call it first, then. Ma says I gotter
say it first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Hepsy</span>—Reckon he’ll hafter, ef his ma says so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—I’m running this school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Hepsy</span>—Mebbe so, mebbe so; but you don’t know Hanner
Ann Jenkins ’s well ’s I do, or you’d know thet ef she’d made up
her mind thet Ruby sh’d speak first, she’ll have him do it, ef it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
breaks up the whole entertainment. Hev’n’t you ever noticed thet

ere song, Miss Peppergrass, you’re a genyus. It’s the truest and
funniest thing I ever heerd. And the funniest part of it is, the men
folks’ll never know how funny it reely is! It’s human natur, sure
enough. ’Twas wuth comin’ in, jest to hear that one song. What’s
next on the programmy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—“Santa Claus.” An original composition by Betsey
Jones.</p>

<p>(<i>Betsey comes out, unfolds her composition very deliberately,
and reads her title with emphasis.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsey</span>—“Sandy Claws!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Hepsey</span>—Hain’t you pernouncin’ his name kinder odd-like,
Betsey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—That’s what I think, but—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsey</span>—’Tis Sandy Claws. Uncle Sol says so, and he’s the oldest
man in this town. He says folkses allers used to say it so, and it’s
jest a new-fangled notion to change it. ’N he said if I’d read it
jest as I writ it, he’d give me ten cents, ’n I’m a goin’ to do it. I
never had ten cents to once’t before, ’n I’m a goin’ to get it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Hepsey</span>—Don’t blame ye a bit. Ef anybody kin git ten cents
outen old Sol Perkins, it’s their bounden duty to do it, say I. Go
on, Betsey, ’n read it up good ’n loud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsey</span>—“Sandy Claws.”—Sandy Claws is an old, old man, older
than Methuselah ever dreamed of be<i>ing</i>. He lives in a big snow
house, built around the North Pole, and uses the Pole for a flag
staff. He is very fat and jolly, with a big ponderosity in front. His
belt is so long it has to be made to order. His eyes are the kind
that twinkle and laugh all by themselves. His nose is round and
red, like a little apple. His cheeks are, too, what you can see of
’em. They are mostly covered by his whiskers. His whiskers are
very predominant. They grow as thick as a crop of well fertilized
clover in a good hay year. His hair is long, thick, and curly, so
that if he bumps his head gett<i>ing</i> down a chimbley, it won’t hurt
him none—I mean not any. These hair and whiskers are of a
sandy color, which is one reason he is called <i>Sandy</i> Claws. The
other reason is because he has claws.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Hepsey</span>—Hold on there, Betsey! I’ve seen many a picture
of Sandy Claws in my day, but nary a one that had claws.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Nor, I, Miss Bascom, but if Uncle Sol says so—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Hepsey</span>—Land yes, there’s no disputin’ Sol Perkins. He’s
sailed around the world, ’n lived with the Feejees ’n the Hottentots,
’n if you doubt ary one o’ his sailor yarns, he’ll up ’n say, “Wal, was
<i>you</i> ever there?” ’n course you never wasn’t ’n there ’tis. But
claws on Sandy Claws is most too much ter swaller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsey</span>—Uncle Sol’s seen old Sandy Claws with his own eyes,
’n he <i>knows</i>. Sandy saved him when he was wrecked in Baffin
Bay, ’n he lived with him most six months, till it come Christmuss
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Hepsey</span>—Wal, wal! I knew Sol had ben wrecked some two
or three hundred times, but I never heered of <i>that</i> time afore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betsey</span>—Nor I, till I hed this ere comporishing to write, ’n then
he told me. He’d allers kep it a secret afore. (<i>reads</i>) His claws
are not on his fingers, but on his toes, ’n when he finds a bad child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a-sleepin’ (I mean sleep<i>ing</i> with his stock<i>ing</i> hang<i>ing</i> up by the
chimbley), he jest scratches him good ’n hard with them claws o’
his’n, and whops up chimbley again, ’n leaves it hang there empty,
less’n he puts in a stick. He brings beautiful things to good girls
and boys, and I hope he’ll bring me a diamond necklace this year,
or at least a gold chain with a diamond locket. I’ve wished for them
every year since I was a child, and although he has not brought
them, I haven’t given up hop<i>ing</i> yet.—Betsey Euphemia Perkins,
aged 12.</p>

<p>There, Teacher, didn’t I say them “ings” good? I never dropped
none.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Very good indeed, Betsey, and your composition is certainly
original, with your Uncle Sol, at least. (<i>Betsey takes seat.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Hepsey</span>—That’ll please Sol—that ere compliment. He doos
hate ter have any body doubt his stories—and after all, <i>we’ve</i> never
went to sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>—Next is a recitation by Aaron and Mosetta Peaslee.</p>

were to learn another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miriam</span>—(<i>rising</i>) ’Tis another, Teacher—or rather it’s the same
one made longer. Ma she said it was too bad to change it when
’twas so ’proprate, ’n Reuben’s mother she fixed it up fer ’em. It’s
good, now, Teacher, really, ’n Ma she says it’s that or nothin’. ’N if
they can’t speak it, we can’t any of us come to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aaron</span>—Says Aaron, “With my shearses<sup>3</sup>, we’ll trim off our earses<sup>4</sup>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mosetta</span>—Says Moses, “I fearses ’twould bring the tearses.”<sup>5</sup></p>

<div class="adtitle2">Christmas Entertainments</div>


<p><b>CHRISTMAS AT PUNKIN HOLLER.</b> A new Christmas play by Elizabeth
F. Guptill that abounds in clean, wholesome fun from beginning to end.
It depicts the trials of the teacher of an old-fashioned “deestric school” in
conducting the last rehearsal for the Christmas Entertainment. Some of the
pupils are in “custom,” as big Jake puts it, and “Sandy Claus” is there. The
children go through their parts with gusto and more or less success. May be
given in any schoolroom by any number. Easy to produce. Costumes simple.
Children and grown-ups will be delighted with CHRISTMAS AT PUNKIN
HOLLER. Price, 15 cents.</p>

<p><b>A TOPSY TURVY CHRISTMAS.</b> Another new Christmas play by
Elizabeth F. Guptill. It is decidedly humorous from start to finish. The
characters are strong and at every turn of the play there is a happy surprise
for the audience. The children are tired of “minding,” and the everything being
“just so,” so they start to find a place where they will find things different.
They find it in Topsy Turvy Land, where they have strange experiences.
When at last they have a Topsy Turvy Christmas, they are ready to go home
and be satisfied with things just as they are. May be given in any schoolroom
by any number of children not less than fifteen. In two short scenes.
This clever play will prove a sure winner wherever produced. Price, 15 cents.</p>

<p><b>CHRISTMAS AT McCARTHY’S.</b> Elizabeth P. Guptill. Here is a new
Christmas play for the older children and as many young children as are
available. It combines in a marked degree the gentlest pathos and the most
sparkling humor. Several nationalities are represented in the tenement and
there is opportunity for the introduction of specialties if desired. Circumstances
cause Elsie, the tenement orphan, to believe Jimmy, the newsboy, will
buy her a Christmas present, and it seems it is up to Jimmy to do it. Christmas
is an unknown quantity at the tenement, but all agree that Elsie must not
be disappointed, and plan to have one somehow. The entertainment is given
by the “inhabitints thimsilves,” at McCarthy’s. In the midst of the fun,
Elsie’s lost father walks in, and the finale is a general rejoicing. Price, 25c.</p>

Guptill. A drill for any even number of boys and girls, or all girls. The
girls carry garlands of evergreen while the boys carry wreaths of the same.
After a spectacular drill and fancy march they all sing a beautiful Christmas
song, which accompanies the drill. Following the song they wind a spiral to
the center of the stage, unwind same and march off. Complete instructions
are given. It is the best Christmas drill ever published; easy to produce and
decidedly novel. Price, 15 cents.</p>

<p><b>PEARL’S CHRISTMAS.</b> Original, pleasing and interesting Christmas
dialogue with an excellent moral, for 3 boys and 4 girls. Price, 5 cents;
seven copies, 25 cents.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
